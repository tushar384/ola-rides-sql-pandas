    ```

### 7️⃣ Peak Hours Heatmap  
- **Purpose**: Heatmap to visualize peak hours for rides across the week.
- **Business Insight**: Helps determine dynamic pricing times and driver allocation.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    import plotly.graph_objs as go
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Heatmap(z=df['Ride_Count'], x=df['Hour'], y=df['Day_of_Week'], colorscale='Viridis'))
    fig.update_layout(title='Peak Hours Heatmap')
    fig.show()
    ```

### 8️⃣ Customer Retention Rates  
- **Purpose**: Visualize retention rates across different months.
- **Business Insight**: Indicates effectiveness of loyalty programs.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    fig = px.area(df, x='Month', y='Retention_Rate', title='Customer Retention Rate Over Time')
    fig.show()
    ```

### 9️⃣ Driver Location Density Map  
- **Purpose**: Geographic map showing driver locations and density.
- **Business Insight**: Helps with supply-demand balancing in different locations.
- **Code**:
    ```python
    fig = px.density_mapbox(df, lat='Latitude', lon='Longitude', z='Driver_Count', radius=10, mapbox_style="stamen-terrain")
    fig.show()
    ```
